# O(s+t)  as iterarte both strings
# memory complexity is O(s+t) as building hashmap requires extra memory

# solution 2
# using Counter
class Solution:

# time complexity and memory is the same as solution 1

# what if no extra memory?
# can sort both strings inplace first then compare each elements one by one
# depends on the sorting algorithm choosen, time complexity can be O(n^2) or O(nlogn)
